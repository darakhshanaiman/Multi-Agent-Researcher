This approach is particularly valuable for distinguishing genuine transits from various false positive scenarios, including eclipsing binaries and instrumental artifacts.\n\nForward LSTM (processes sequence left-to-right): [...] In this study, we hypothesize that explicit temporal modeling using bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs), combined with an attention mechanism, can improve classification performance on ambiguous or low-SNR transit signals. The BiLSTM component enables the model to capture long-range sequential information across the light curve, while the attention layer provides interpretability by highlighting which parts of the sequence influence the classification decision. Together, these additions extend the [...] periodic features, asymmetries, or flux dips that are typical of planetary transits. Max pooling, which shortens the sequence length while keeping important activations, comes after each convolution. The Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) layer takes the convolved sequence and captures temporal dependencies in both forward and backward directions. This ability is especially important for modeling transit features that may be symmetric, skewed, or spread across multiple bins, since\n\nSource: https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/09/aa46417-23/aa46417-23.html\nContent: Initially, the approach involved using the RV time series and treating the problem as a classification task, with each number of planets representing a separate class. We experimented with convolutional and LSTM networks. However, it very quickly became clear that this classification approach did not fit the problem well, as the classes were not mutually exclusive. Consequently, the tests did not yield any substantial improvements over random classification. [...] This particular type of problem – where an input is considered and has to be assigned to one of two classes (here, planet or not planet) – is called a binary classification problem. In this type of problem, it is very important to consider the balance of the classes in the dataset – that is, the fraction of instances from each case – and the metrics used during training. For example, if an algorithm is trained with many more cases of a given class, it may be biased against predicting the [...] for the performance of ExoplANNET used as part of the Virtual Astronomer.

The LSTM classifier was trained for 13 epochs and achieved an accuracy of 89.5%, a precision of 1.00, a recall of 89.4%, and an F1-score of 0.944 on the validation subset.\n2. The confusion matrix and ROC curve indicate a high separability between classes with an AUC of 0.98, confirming the effectiveness of the LSTM classifier in detecting planetary transit signals.\n3. The dataset used in this study is derived from the publicly available Kepler light curve archive, which contains time-series photometric observations of stellar brightness from the Kepler space telescope.\n4. Each record corresponds to a stellar flux sequence consisting of 3197 brightness measurements, and the dataset contains 570 samples initially labelled as either 1 (exoplanet candidate) or 2 (non-exoplanet).\n5. The labelled time-series dataset serves as the input for both the LSTM-based classification and autoencoder-based reconstruction tasks, and all flux curves were normalized to enhance model convergence and reduce scale-related variance.\n6. The overall workflow of the project consists of six major stages: data preprocessing and analysis, feature extraction, model training, model evaluation, model selection, and deployment on observational datasets from TESS and JWST."}}], "type": "doc"}

This method aims to reduce the numerical precision of model parameters by quantizing the weights and activations to a lower bit-width representation . Quantization achieves this by mapping the continuous floating-point values of weights and activations to a limited set of discrete values. The number of bits required for each parameter can typically be reduced to as low as 8 bits or even 4 bits without significant loss of [...] Quantization, in the context of vision transformers, is a method for implementing sparsity and reducing the complexity. It involves converting the floating-point weights of a vision transformer into a compressed fixed-point format. This process is integral to optimizing the model for better performance on hardware such as GPUs. By applying quantization, the model’s size and computational load are significantly reduced, making it more efficient for tasks in the vision domain. This efficiency is [...] accuracy in the model .

By constraining weights to just two values, −1 and +1, memory usage is reduced dramatically — even beyond what 4-bit quantization offers — while binary arithmetic greatly simplifies hardware operations. This leads to substantial improvements in energy efficiency and computational speed, especially during large-scale inference. [...] tracking which layers are quantized in which way, adding complexity to both training and inference. Sparse operations, while efficient for small batches, can be a poor fit for hardware optimized for dense computation — so the theoretical gains may not fully materialize in high-throughput or production settings. [...] Despite early successes, current quantization techniques face significant limitations. Smaller models, in particular, are much more sensitive to reduced precision — often experiencing sharp accuracy drops or instability when weights are quantized to as low as 4 bits.\n\nSource: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3524066\nContent: In this study, we propose a novel compression framework, termed as quantized sparse training, to address the above-mentioned limitations encountered while applying pruning and quantization simultaneously. Quantized sparse training is a compression framework that unifies training, pruning, and quantization. To achieve this, we introduce a quantized pruning function that integrates pruning and quantization procedures into a single function. In addition, we estimate the gradient of the [...] Weight quantization discretizes the weights and activations of DNNs into a finite number of values. Quantization approaches can be categorized into QAT and PTQ. QAT methods [7, 17, 23, 38] have shown increasingly robust performance in the low-precision domain. Gradient-based training of quantized DNNs is difficult, because the gradient of a quantization function is zero in almost everywhere. An approach to address the problem is to use DNNs with stochastic weights and optimize the evidence [...] Another limitation is that a large search space requires to be explored to determine the optimal combination of the pruning rate and quantization bitwidths. It has been observed that the individual layers in a model have different optimal pruning rates  and quantization bitwidths . Joint pruning and quantization further increases the difficulty of manually choosing the compression ratios or hyper-parameter tuning, since the layer-wise sparsity and quantization bitwidth affect each other.

[...] Exploiting sparsity in deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a promising area for meeting the growing computation requirements. To minimize the overhead of sparse acceleration, hardware designers have proposed structured sparsity support, but it provides limited flexibility and requires extra model fine-tuning. Moreover, any sparse model fine-tuned for certain structured sparse HW cannot be accelerated by other structured hardware. To enable acceleration using unstructured sparsity of DNNs on [...] A critical approach for efficiently deploying Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with massive parameters is quantization. However, state-of-the-art MoE models suffer from non-negligible accuracy loss with extreme quantization, such as under 4 bits. To address this, we introduce MiLo, a novel method that augments highly quantized MoEs with a mixture of low-rank compensators.
