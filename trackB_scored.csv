Hunting in Deep Space dataset used in this study is de-
rived from the publicly availableKeplerlight curve archive,
which contains time-series photometric observations of stellar
brightness from the Kepler space telescope.
Each record corresponds to a stellar flux sequence con-
sisting of 3197 brightness measurements. The dataset con-
tains 570 samples, initially labelled as either1(exoplanet
candidate) or2(non-exoplanet). For the purpose of binary
classification, the labels were cleaned and transformed to a
standard binary format:1indicating a confirmed planetary
transit, and0indicating its absence.
This labelled time-series dataset serves as the input for both
the LSTM-based classification and autoencoder-based recon-
struction tasks. All flux curves were normalised to enhance
model convergence and reduce scale-related variance.

However, from the retrieved web evidence:

- Source 1 mentions that quantization is another technique to achieve sparsity in transformers and reduces the numerical precision of model parameters by quantizing the weights and activations to a lower bit-width representation. However, it does not mention specific limitations.
- Source 2 mentions that despite early successes, current quantization techniques face significant limitations, including smaller models being much more sensitive to reduced precision, which can lead to sharp accuracy drops or instability when weights are quantized to as low as 4 bits.
- Source 3 mentions that one limitation of quantization is that a large search space is required to be explored to determine the optimal combination of the pruning rate and quantization bitwidths, and that individual layers in a model have different optimal pruning rates and quantization bitwidths.
- Source 4 mentions that extreme quantization, such as under 4 bits, can lead to non-negligible accuracy loss in state-of-the-art MoE models.
- Source 5 mentions that per-channel quantization can lead to improved model performance, but increases the complexity of the quantization process.

Apple is ramping up succession plans for CEO Tim Cook, a Friday report says.Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic [...] In May, Sam Altman’s OpenAI acquired startup io for about $6.5 billion, bringing in former Apple chief designer Jony Ive to build AI devices. The 58-year-old designer was instrumental in creating the iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

Cook, Apple’s former operations chief, turned 65 this month. He has grown the company’s market capitalization to $4 trillion from $350 billion in 2011, when he took over the CEO role from company co-founder Steve Jobs.

Apple was on the verge of collapse when founder Steve Jobs rejoined the company in 1997. Cook joined Apple shortly thereafter in 1998 as senior vice president of worldwide operations. The visionary Jobs and new products such as the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone received much of the media attention during Apple’s turnaround, but Cook’s successful streamlining of the company’s supply chain and operations were equally critical. [...] In November 2025, the Financial Times reported that Apple’s board had intensified its succession planning. By then, Cook had become the longest-serving CEO in Apple’s history, reflecting a tenure that reshaped the company into one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies.

The visionary Jobs and new products such as the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone received much of the media attention during Apple’s turnaround, but Cook’s successful streamlining of the company’s supply chain and operations were equally critical. [...] In November 2025, the Financial Times reported that Apple’s board had intensified its succession planning. By then, Cook had become the longest-serving CEO in Apple’s history, reflecting a tenure that reshaped the company into one of the world’s most valuable and influential companies.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that combines the strengths of two techniques: retrieval-based models and generation-based models. 

In retrieval-based models, the AI system searches a large database or knowledge base to find relevant information that matches a given query. 

Generation-based models, on the other hand, use machine learning algorithms to generate text or responses based on patterns and structures learned from a large dataset.

RAG models combine these two approaches by first retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base, and then using this information to generate a response or text that is more accurate and informative. This is often achieved through a multi-step process involving a retriever (which searches the knowledge base) and a generator (which generates the final response based on the retrieved information).",1531,web,136,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,,,

Document your idea

Document your idea","To invent missing results, I will follow the given process from one of the provided sources and use my discretion to fill in the gaps based on the information provided.

From the provided document context: https://www.uspto.gov/kids/lets-start-creating, it is mentioned that writing down every idea, even if it seems silly or impossible, can lead to the best inventions. It also emphasizes the importance of talking to friends, family, or classmates to get different perspectives.

Next, I will use this process to create a hypothetical invention.

**Invention Idea:** A Smart Gardening System

**Step 1: Conceptualize**

The Smart Gardening System would be a device that helps people with limited mobility or those who live in small spaces to grow their own plants. It would be a compact, automated system that can be placed on a balcony or in a small backyard.

**Step 2: Write Down Ideas**

Some ideas that come to mind for the Smart Gardening System include:

- A self-watering system that can detect soil moisture levels and water the plants accordingly
- A temperature control system that can adjust the temperature to optimize plant growth
- A sensor that can detect pests and diseases, and alert the user to take action
- An app that can provide personalized gardening tips and recommendations based on the user's location and plant type

**Step 3: Talk to Others**

I would talk to a friend who is an expert in horticulture to get their input on the idea. They might suggest adding features such as:

- A built-in irrigation system that can detect and adapt to changing weather conditions
- A system that can detect and adjust for nutrient deficiencies in the soil
- A feature that can provide real-time monitoring of plant health and growth

**Step 4: Test, Evaluate, and Redesign**

Once the Smart Gardening System is built, I would test it out with a small group of users to see how it works and what features are most useful. I would also gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.

**Step 5: Document the Idea**

I would document the idea, including the features, benefits, and potential market size. I would also research existing products in the market to see how the Smart Gardening System compares and how it can be differentiated.

**Step 6: Submit the Invention Disclosure**

I would submit the invention disclosure to a patent attorney to review and advise on the best course of action for protecting the intellectual property.
